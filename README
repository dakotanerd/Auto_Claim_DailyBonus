## 📌 Overview

This Python script automatically opens the Stake daily bonus page and claims the daily bonus using **screen automation**.

It works by:

* Opening the Stake daily bonus URL in your default browser
* Navigating the page using keyboard input
* Locating the **"Claim Bonus"** button on screen via image recognition
* Clicking the button automatically
* Waiting 24 hours before repeating the process

## 🧰 Requirements

### Operating System

* **Windows (recommended)**
* Linux/macOS with GUI support (not headless)

> ❌ **WSL without GUI will NOT work**

### Software

* Python **3.9+**
* A graphical desktop environment

### Python Libraries

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pyautogui pillow opencv-python
```

## 🖼️ button.png (IMPORTANT)

`button.png` must be:

* A **clear screenshot** of the exact "Claim Bonus" button
* Taken at **100% display scaling**
* Matching your browser theme (light/dark)

If the script cannot find the button, retake this screenshot.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell)

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Desktop\stuff\Computer_Science_Projects\SnakeCasino_AutoClaim_DailyBonus"
```

### 2. Run the script

```powershell
python StakeCasiono_ClaimDailyBonus.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can tweak these values inside the script:

| Variable             | Description                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `PAGE_LOAD_WAIT`     | Seconds to wait for page load           |
| `DAILY_WAIT`         | Time between claims (default 24h + 30s) |
| `CLAIM_BUTTON_IMAGE` | Image used for detection                |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Opens Stake daily bonus URL
2. Waits for the page to fully load
3. Focuses the browser window
4. Uses keyboard navigation (TAB + ENTER)
5. Searches the screen for `button.png`
6. Moves the mouse smoothly and clicks
7. Starts a 24-hour countdown

## 🛑 Common Issues

### ❌ Button Not Found

* Retake `button.png`
* Disable browser zoom
* Ensure Stake page is visible on screen

### ❌ PyAutoGUI Display Errors

* Run on **Windows Python**, not WSL
* Ensure a monitor is connected

---

## 🔒 Safety Tips

* Do not move your mouse while script runs
* Do not minimize the browser
* Run when the computer will stay unlocked
* Consider running once per day instead of looping

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)

* Selenium-based browser automation
* Multi-account support
* Headless-safe logic (non-GUI)
* Error recovery and logging
